                <p>While its name literally means ‘meat bone tea’, there is actually no tea to be found in Bak Kut Teh. The tea in its name instead refers to a strong oolong Chinese tea which is usually served alongside the soup in the belief that it dilutes the large amounts of fat in this dish. The broth of pork ribs with herbs, garlic and spices is cooked for as long as possible – sometimes even days – to give it a rich flavour. To find the best ‘BKT’ as it is often affectionately called, go to Klang, where coffee shops and street food centres serve it. </p>

                <p>Roti Jala, or ‘net bread’, gets its name from the lines that are created by drizzling batter on a large skillet. The final product is folded up like a crepe and usually served with a curry.</p>

                <p>Twa ko is a Cambodian sausage made from beef or pork and various spices. Just like any good homemade sausage, the authentic Khmer sausage contains at least 20-25% fat.Some prefer to use pork belly as the main ingredient; it definitely serves the purpose well. Twa ko can be enjoyed on its own in barbecued, grilled or pan-fried style or served with steamed rice and fresh vegetables.</p>

                <p>The simple and yummy bai sach chrouk is pork marinated in coconut milk or garlic before being brought to a slow grill. It's then served with broken or fractured rice and a small bowl of clear chicken broth as well as some fresh vegetables.As part of the street food culture, it is available everywhere especially in busy neighborhoods. It’s so popular that many middle and upper restaurants also include it on their menus. Try it with iced coffee. The pairing can be very satisfying.</p>
